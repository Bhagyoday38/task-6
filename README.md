Password Strength Evaluation Report
Objective:
To understand what constitutes a strong password and evaluate its strength using online tools.

 Passwords Created for Evaluation:
Simple Password: password123

Moderate Complexity: Summer2025!

High Complexity: G7r$2nV!lQ9zX8

Passphrase: BlueSky$Dances!UnderMoon

Randomly Generated: 9u$W2f!Kq8Zx@L

 Evaluation Using Online Password Strength Checker:
Using the online tool PasswordMeter, the following evaluations were made:

Password	Strength Score	Feedback
password123	Weak	Common password; easily guessable.
Summer2025!	Moderate	Contains uppercase, numbers, and symbols; still predictable.
G7r$2nV!lQ9zX8	Strong	High entropy; includes uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
BlueSky$Dances!UnderMoon	Very Strong	Long passphrase; highly unpredictable.
9u$W2f!Kq8Zx@L	Very Strong	Randomly generated; high complexity.

 Analysis and Best Practices:
Length Over Complexity: Longer passwords are generally more secure. Aim for at least 16 characters.

Avoid Common Patterns: Passwords like password123 are easily guessable.

Use Passphrases: Combining unrelated words can create memorable yet strong passwords.

Randomness is Key: Randomly generated passwords with a mix of characters are harder to crack.

Unique Passwords for Each Account: Reusing passwords increases vulnerability.
